# Quine-McCluskey-Algorithm

This is an old project I made after taking a Digital Logic class at college. It takes a vector of minterms and "don't cares" and combines them using the Quine-McCluskey algorithm into a simpler logic function that produces the same minterms.

As far as I can remember, the code works but I have not looked at it in a few months. Last time I touched it I was in the process of adding features to make it easier to use and adding comments to explain and make the code easier to understand. I hope to finish the project up when I have time soon.
